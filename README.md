Data Mining and Machine leanring (Model prediction) with R using Historical Data Set.
# NBA_MVP player prediction model

This is project where we are using the NBA data set from Kaggle which is a historical data set consisting of all the information about the NBA player performances since 1950's.

This Project aims at taking advantage of second-hand National Basketball Association (NBA) historical datasets and using different data mining techniques to measure the performance of a player in a single year and trying to create a useful model to predict whether that player could win the most valuable player (MVP) award.

The motivation behind the project was to introduce Machine learning power to the NBA world and help make a very crucial decision like below which based on the NBA MVP awards:

•	The business value of this means that this model can be used to predict MVP even before the real results based on the seasonal performance basis. Thus, the managers of the teams can retain a player or sign a new contract with him before getting the MVP award which will save a lot of money as suddenly the fees and rates of contracts increase with the market value of the Player.

•	The Betting industry earns a lot, thereby using this prediction model adds some statistics to the Bets.

•	Other than for a team owner in NBA, lots of big business companies have NBA famous stars as there Brand Ambassador. A decision can be made using this model before the launch of new products if the player is good, but maybe not winning the MVP this year than launching a product after the award announcement may lead to affect the sales of the product. This situation can be anticipated earlier.

•	A similar new MVP can be predicted and signed before the award declaration, which can lead to low-cost deals and the early decision of launching products with correct players before competitors.  


In this Project, the following efforts that engage in data mining, including:
•	Retrieve the related historical player stats and MVP datasets online 
•	Preprocessing individual dataset
•	Merge different datasets
•	Check correction between data
•	Generate, train and validate the MVP prediction model
