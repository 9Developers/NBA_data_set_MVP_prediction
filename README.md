Data Mining and Machine leanring (Model prediction) with R using Historical Data Set.
# NBA_data_set_MVP_prediction

This is project where we are using the NBA data set from Kaggle which is a historical data set consisting of all the information about the NBA player performances since 1950's.

This Project aims at taking advantage of second-hand National Basketball Association (NBA) historical datasets and using different data mining techniques to measure the performance of a player in a single year and trying to create a useful model to predict whether that player could win the most valuable player (MVP) award.

In this Project, the following efforts that engage in data mining, including:
•	Retrieve the related historical player stats and MVP datasets online 
•	Preprocessing individual dataset
•	Merge different datasets
•	Check correction between data
•	Generate, train and validate the MVP prediction model
